    Do the 6 coding problems found in the Recursion Lecture notes.

       Note: If it asks you to write a program... write and run the code you wrote.. etc...

       Assignment 1 – Draw a diagram illustrating the values as the function is called… and the values
as each call is retuned….
 Use filename: Week#YourNameProg1
Assignment 2 - Write a non-recursive version of this function… using a regular while loop. Use
filename: Week#YourNameProg2

Assignment 3 – For example 2, draw a diagram illustrating the values as the function is called…
and the values as each call is retuned…. Use filename: Week#YourNameProg3
Assignment 4 - For example 2, write a non-recursive version of this function… using a regular
while loop.
Use filename: Week#YourNameProg4
Assignment 5 - Write a recursive function that adds up the numbers 1 to 12. Use
filename: Week#YourNameProg5
Assignment 6 - Write a non-recursive version of assignment 5… using a regular for loop.
Use filename: Week#YourNameProg6
